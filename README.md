# facial-expression-recognition-OpenCV
Facial Expression Recognition using keras, tensorflow and OpenCV. 

The dataset used for training the CNN is from a kaggle competition 

The model architecture used for building the CNN is from the research paper in the 1307.0414.pdf

The model architecture is presented in model.png

OpenCV is used to detect the face using Haar Cascade Classifire

The trained model is stored as a JSON string

A basic HTML file is in index.html in order to detect the face expression in a browser
